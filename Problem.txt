You are tasked with designing a simulation of a car dealership using object-oriented programming
and inheritance in Java. The simulation should consist of a Car class, a Salesperson class, and a
Dealership class.
The Car class should have the following properties: make, model, year, color, price, and mileage. It
should also have a method for calculating the depreciation of the car based on its age and mileage.
The Salesperson class should have the following properties: name, age, and a list of cars that they
have sold. It should also have a method for calculating their commission based on the total sales they
have made.
The Dealership class should have the following properties: name, address, and a list of cars that are
currently in stock. It should also have methods for adding and removing cars from the stock, as well
as for calculating the total value of the cars in stock.
In addition to these classes, you should also create a subclass of the Car class for each type of car that
the dealership sells (e.g. Sedan, SUV, Truck, Mehran, Alto, Corolla, BMW, Cultus, Swift, Vitz, Passo,
Pino, Picanto, move, Mira). Each subclass should have additional properties and methods specific to
that type of car.
